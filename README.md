# Text_to_Speech

The Text-to-Speech project using gtts (Google Text-to-Speech) is a simple yet powerful Python application that converts written text into spoken audio.
With this project, you can transform any text into speech, making it useful for creating audiobooks,
voice assistants, or enhancing accessibility for visually impaired users.
The gtts module utilizes Google's Text-to-Speech API,
allowing you to generate high-quality speech in multiple languages. By providing the desired text, the program generates an audio file that can be played back or used in various applications. This project is an excellent demonstration of how Python and modern APIs can be leveraged to make technology more accessible and inclusive.
